# Monte Carlo Simulation Project
**STAT 7100 â€“ Statistical Methods (Summer 2025)**\
In this project, your team will design and conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study based on a real-world context. Rather than abstract synthetic scenarios, each team will choose an application domain such as public health, supply chains, sports analytics, finance, or environmental monitoring.

While you will simulate data, your design must be rooted in a realistic dataset, scenario, or journal article that provides motivation for the distributions and assumptions you use. The focus is on learning how to model randomness and uncertainty using tools from this course.
