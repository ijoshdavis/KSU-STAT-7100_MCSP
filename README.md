# Monte Carlo Simulation Project
**STAT 7100 â€“ Statistical Methods (Summer 2025)**\
In this project, your team will design and conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study based on a real-world context. Rather than abstract synthetic scenarios, each team will choose an application domain such as public health, supply chains, sports analytics, finance, or environmental monitoring.

While you will simulate data, your design must be rooted in a realistic dataset, scenario, or journal article that provides motivation for the distributions and assumptions you use. The focus is on learning how to model randomness and uncertainty using tools from this course.

## ðŸ“… Deadlines
* Week 4	Submit group info, topic, and a brief idea	June 20
* Week 6	Status report with partial code and participation update	July 4
* Week 8	Final report, code, and presentation	July 18

## ðŸ§  AI Usage Policy
* Up to 10% of code or text can originate from AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot).
* You must document any AI use in an [Appendix: AI Log](deliverables/Appendix:%20AI%20Log.txt).
* What tools were used.
* What parts of the code/text it helped generate.
* How you reviewed/verified the results.
* Clearly label AI-assisted content in comments or footnotes.

## âœ… Evaluation Rubric Highlights
* Clarity and feasibility of simulation design.
* Justification of statistical assumptions.
* Quality and reproducibility of code.
* Accuracy and depth of analysis.
* Professional communication (written and oral).
* Transparency and ethical use of AI tools.
