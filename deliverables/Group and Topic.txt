Topic:
Loan Approval Risk Simulation for Aging Population

On this project, we will simulate long-term approval and risk for an aging population over a 50-year horizon. The goal of this project is to estimate how the profitability of lending decisions changes as borrower demographics shift, mainly with increasing average age. We will use Monte Carlo methods to model borrower cash flows, behavior, and default probability under different loan approval thresholds.

We also plan to use machine learning to predict borrower default risk based on attributes like age, income, and health status. By differentiating multiple risk thresholds and policy strategies, we will identify which lending basis maximizes long-term expected profit and manages risk in an aging society.
